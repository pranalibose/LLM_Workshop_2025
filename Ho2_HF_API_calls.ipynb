While I didn’t know the acronym back then, I was hooked on the idea of a computer making decisions and predicting the future (or optimizing given data). I started taking small steps towards AI by learning about Logic programming and Bayesian Networks in high school.\n",

I’d recommend buying the Prep-test Companion Book by Princeton Review and following the practice plan outlined in it. Personally, I found it to be the most effective form of practice as it helped me familiarize myself with the concepts and question formats. More importantly, Princeton Review has validated their study plans via research, so you know that the way they structure their practice material is the best approach towards cracking that 101st percentile.\n",

My two favorites are Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course offered by Coursera – it’s free and is a 10-week, fully-fledged course that covers various machine learning algorithms and intuitive concepts. To learn deep learning, check out Ian Goodfellow’s course on deep learning by Francois Chollet (creator of Keras).\n",

            "– As for specific courses, anything that involves Statistics, Optimization, Information Theory and Probability would be extremely useful. You can imagine these subjects as pre-requisites to diving into machine and deep learning! For the best results, start with basic statistics and gradually attempt the more advanced topics.\n",

            "1. Use consistent formatting for headings: The resume uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters for headings, which can be visually distracting. To make the resume more professional and consistent, use all uppercase letters for headings (e.g., Education, Skills, etc.) and all lowercase letters for job titles and bullet points.\n",
            "2. Include specific numbers and achievements: While John Doe provides brief descriptions of his projects, it would be more effective to quantify his accomplishments with specific numbers whenever possible. For example, instead of writing \"Built a predictive model to analyze customer churn for a large retail customer,\" he could write \"Built a predictive model that reduced customer churn by 20% for a large retail customer.\"\n",
            "3. Optimize the layout for readability: The resume is currently formatted as a single column, which can be hard to read on mobile devices and smaller screens. To make it easier for potential employers to view the resume, consider using a two-column format or optimizing the text size and spacing for smaller screens.\n",
            "4. Use action verbs: John Doe uses action verbs in some bullet points, but it would be helpful to use them consistently throughout the resume. Action verbs can make the resume more dynamic and help the reader quickly understand John Doe's role in each project.\n",
            "5. Include relevant certifications and technical skills: While John Doe mentions his expertise in Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, it would be helpful to include specific certifications or courses he has completed to demonstrate his mastery of these areas. Additionally, he could consider adding other technical skills he has, such as SQL, Java, or R, to make his resume more comprehensive.\n",
